                        "Hello! I'm an eager Purdue Engineer in the Startup/VC world! Over the past few years, I have built a wide variety of projects- ranging from an autonomous photography drone, a liquid-fueled rocket engine, a novel sports analytics product, and a cutting edge agriculture stereo imaging system.  \ud835\udddc \ud835\uddee\ud835\uddfa \ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude03\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff \ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf1\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf2.  You will see me constantly coding a side project or buying materials from McMaster. Here are some of my current projects: - A powerful music analytics database compiled from the Spotify, Genius, Musixmatch, and YouTube APIs. As far as I have found it is the largest single compiled database from all these sources. My goal is to analyze trends from over 400 GB of data to predict which artist will have the next big song, how words/phrases are trending over time, and how \"genres\" of music are clustered in our mind.   - A mobile application used to schedule rowing lineups weeks in advance and integrate rowers statistics more directly into the lineup creating process. Using Flutter and Firebase, I am working to help coaches make the fastest boats possible for their teams.  My real passion lies in entertainment technology- projects like innovative roller coaster designs, visual and audial spatial mapping, AI generated music, and whatever technologies will take over the future of entertainment. I have a Notion page full of ideas that I add to multiple times a day.  \ud835\udddc \ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddfb \ud835\uddf3\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude00\ud835\ude01.  One side effect of having a wide variety of interests is that I have learned how to quickly research topics and learn new software. Just in my free time, I have learned how to use Blender, Unity, OBS, Logic Pro, and Final Cut. I learned react native in just two weeks, then built a backend on Express and EC2 in days.  \ud835\udddc \ud835\uddee\ud835\uddfa \ud835\uddee \ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf1\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfc.  When I was 15 years old, I brought together 50+ volunteers to help revitalize an area of a local park. I learned the importance of being confident and decisive, yet cordial. Since then, I have led many project teams across different goals and disciplines. I learned to be accountable to school sponsors, assign meaningful tasks to team members, and command attention during introductions or presentations.  My leadership was pushed hardest when I recruited and led a year-long research project developing a new data collection product for my crew team. I learned how to empower my engineers to be most productive through communication, planning, and emphasizing focus on our goal. Most importantly, I learned how to organize myself and jump between very technical and large-scale goals quickly."

(http://catapulthacks.com/)\"\n\"\"\n\"Purdue Founders and ML@Purdue are teaming up and so proud to announce Catapult - Purdue University's first ever AI + Entrepreneurship Hackathon. \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udca1\"\n\"\"\n\"As a Purdue student working and studying in the AI industry, I've been interested in not only learning about the theoretics of AI/ML in my classes, but also building with the leading technologies available to us today. I've always believed in learning by doing, \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f and believe that Purdue University needs more opportunities for students to build and brand generative AI based projects. This is why we are hosting Purdue\u2019s first ever GenAI + Business Hackathon. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f\ud83d\udcda\"\n\"\"\n\"The Hackathon (called Catapult Hacks) is a university-wide two day in-person event (3/30-3/31) for students across Purdue\u2019s ecosystem to build, learn, and create AI based applications. \ud83d\udcc6 In a unique twist, our hackathon is both a coding challenge and business challenge. Not only must teams utilize the newest AI tech, but they must brand and pitch each idea, being judged on a combination of both by VCs + Purdue Alumni. \ud83d\udcbc\ud83d\udcbb\"\n\"\"\n\"No AI or hackathon experience is required! Teams can be students from any school, but must attend in-person. Join Purdue\u2019s top builders for over $2,000 in prizes, even sponsored by Purdue's very own purdue Institute for Physical Artificial Intelligence. \ud83d\udcb0\"\n\"\"\n\"The team- Sameeha Afrulbasha, Connor Johnson, Shantanu Roy, Saisravani Kuchibhotla and I have poured hundreds of hours enabling this opportunity for hundreds of Purdue students. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\"\n\"\"\n\"Now that you have this incredible opportunity, make the most of it! If you are a student, apply here: http://catapulthacks.com/ by March 18th, 2024 to get involved. We are still looking for sponsors and judges!!

                        "I have been wanting to learn about cognitive architectures in AI systems for a long time. But, as it turns out, delving into such a complex research topic on a whim at 3 AM in the morning is not sustainable. To combat this, I've been trying to read summaries of newer research papers every day.   That's why I build AutoScholar- A simple AI Agent to search the internet every day for research papers relevant to my area of interest (in this case, cognitive architectures!). The agent beautifully summarizes each paper it finds- with an emphasis on impact of the paper- and intelligently sends papers to me it thinks I would find interesting.   As an AI Agent Engineer, I have a lot of experience building with generative AI tools such as GPT-4 and LangChain. To build this particular workflow, I used an automated scheduling tool called n8n to start a LangChain thread that has access to an arXiv tool, allowing it to search through research papers. That system layered with additional summarization prompts and repetition checking allowed me to send relevant papers every few hours (or however often I want). To display the results of the agent to the user, I used Spooky AI's Human API app, which allowed me to send the notifications.",

                        "Depletables are my way of modeling recurring tasks that you must be on top of to be spontaneous. A Depletable is any cyclical task that has a state of \u201cdepletion.\u201d Instead of reactively responding to tasks like home cleaning, shopping, connecting with family, a Depletable notifies you when to accomplish all of these tasks.  To track Depletables, I developed an iPhone app and launched it on the App Store. Instead of saving all my tasks for the dreaded Sunday cleaning, I get an iPhone notification to complete them throughout the week. As a student, this is a great way to balance busy work days and allows me to spend time on the weekend doing what I truly want to do- being spontaneous.  I made a Depletable to clean my bathroom, change my contacts, and clean the fridge. I also made Depletables to text my family members each week and post consistently on social media. After using this app for the past few months, I can genuinely say it has changed the way I live.  By combining Depletables for recurring tasks, a calendar for date-based tasks, a to-do list for random tasks, and time-chunking my continuous tasks, I have built a system that allows me to operate ahead of my deadlines and accomplish more than I thought possible."
